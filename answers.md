1. What is the difference between new and create for a model?
Create automatically saves the information passed into it in the data base, whereas new requires you to manually save the information updates you make.

2. What command combined with new will emulate the same behavior as create?
.save!

3. What is the column that exists on every table but we did NOT define?
ID

4. What single line of ruby code can insert a cat with the name "hat" in the database?
c = Cat.create :name => "hat"

5. What was the most confusing part over the last few weeks?
I think the most confusing part was trying to understand the syntax for the embedded ruby files, and figuring out how to write routes. Also it was confusing trying to figure out which files we were supposed to be making changes to (i.e. make changes in pages_controller or create a new .erb file or create a new .rb file, etc.)

6. How did you like this homework in comparison with the others?
I liked how for the first two questions, helpful links/resources were included to help us complete the questions.
